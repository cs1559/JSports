#JSprts - Program Setup Workflow#
A program can also be referred to as a "season".  Each program has a series of steps that need to be performed prior to the start of the program. These steps include:

1.  Create/Define the Program
2.  Setup/Open Registration
3.  Create/Define Divisions
3.  Assign Divisions to the teams.

The following is a high-level view of the overall flow.

Once you have defined the Program within JSports, you can open the program up for Team registration.  Coaches/Team Managers can then access the application and actually register their team on your website.  The registration does NOT become an actual "team" on the site.  It is held within a registration table until that registration is published.

**If you are using JSPorts as a mechanism to register teams, then there are no futher actions required.  NOTE:  "Registration Only" is an attribute o the program.**

If you know early on what your divisions will be, then you can go ahead and create them.  A division is essentially a group of teams that will compete against each other.  JSports does support cross-divisional play but ONLY within a specific age group.  You can define as many divisions within a given age group you wish.  

Teams need to be assigned to divisions after registration closes.  JSports has an administration page that will allow you to assign multiple teams to multiple divisions at once.
