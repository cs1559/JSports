<h2>Program Setup</h2>
<hr/>
<p>The "program setup" is the function where regisrations/teams are assigned to different divisions within the program.  This function supports a "mass input"
function so assignments can be made in bulk and NOT on an individual basis.  The program setup screen allows you to define a program and a group to filter on. 
The list of available programs is filtered to only those programs where the setup is NOT final and is not used for registration only.  This both are attributes 
on the programs record.
</p>

<p>
Each row will present an individual drop down box.  this drop down box will list all of the available divisions available for that specific program.
</p> 
<p>
There is an underlying table called #__jsports_map which is updated with data entered during the setup process.  This ties together the registration, team and which 
division the team is participating in.   Each entry MUST be published for the team to appear in the standings.

<h2>View Logs</h2>
<p>
The component will generate various log messages in a table called #__jsports_action_logs that can be viewed via the Adminsistrator side of Joomla.
You are able to perform a search of the log messages via this backend function.  The search query will look at the log message and return results based 
on the criteria entered.
</p>
<p>
Log files can (and should be) periodically purged to keep the underlying table as small as possible.  As additional logging messages are added to the 
component, this table could get fairly large.  Currently, the system will delete any log message 6 months or older.
</p>

<h2>Tools</h2>
<p>
This option provides a few tools that help manage the JSports installation.
</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Newsletter Import</b> - this function will collect all emails on 'active' team rosters where an email exists and adds it to the Coaches Mailing list. 
	Currently, JSports supports the NSPro newsletter component only.  Additional adapters are required in order for this to work with other newsletter components.
	</li>
	<li><b>Purge Log Records</b> - This function will systematically delete so many log records that are past 'n' of days.  The number of days is configurable
	at the component level.
	</li>
</ul>
