# JSports - Sports Management
This component is a sports management component that was built to assist in the management of a youth sports league.  This sports league had an annual team membership of nearly 160 teams per yaar.  The key functional areas within this component include, but not limited, to the following:

- League/Organization 
- Programs (similiar to a "season")
- Registration 
- Divisions
- Team Profiles
- Rostering
- Games/Scheduling

Why JSports?  Why not use platforms like TeamSnap, Sports Engine, etc.?  For the league this was built for, it was pretty simple.  All of these platforms are built for what we termed as a "centralized model" where all setup, scheduling, posting of scores, etc. is done by the organization runing the league.  In addition, the core focus of these other platforms are built around payment processing and managing the schedules of all fields/locations under the organizations control.  Those platforms have many great features to support scheduling.  However, again, the league this was built for does not manage all the fields/locations where games are played.  The league covered 160 teams, 7 counties and approximately 40 fields where the league has NO control of the facility.   The leagued used Sports Engine

In a "decentralized" model, responsibility for all data entry of schedules, game scores and rosters is all handled by each team coach (or manager).  The organization itself only setusp the league information, setups the programs and divisions and provides reporting.  The league itself provides a "framework" (structure) for which the teams all operate.

Now, in theory, JSPorts can support both models - centralized or decentralized.  It is the hope of the developer that this component can evolve to provide key functionality for both models.
